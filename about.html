                        I was inspired by teachers who use innovative methods to explain difficult concepts; 
                        that led me to believe that my learning can be complete only when I can help others learn, 
                        irrespective of their current knowledge. As I took up the challenge of helping others learn, 
                        I found it to be the most fulfilling experience of my life, sometimes even more joyful than 
                        acquiring knowledge. I have a lot more to learn in this journey.

                    <p>I have keen interest in mathematics (mainly number theory, algebra) and physics. 
                        In my leisure time I like to play table tennis and
                        story mode video games and listen to smooth songs and write up sometimes ideas or quotes. 
                        I also have interest in discussing politics and acknowledge both the sides of policies and laws.</p>
